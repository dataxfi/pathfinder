## Usage

> `IN` paramater refers to whether the 'token in' (token being sold) is the exact token.

```
const pathfinder = new Pathfinder(1);
try {
  const Path = pathfinder.getTokenPath({
    tokenInAddress: "0x967da4048cd07ab37855c090aaf366e4ce1b9f48",
    tokenOutAddress: "0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48",
    IN: true,
  });
} catch (error) {
    //handle error
}
```

output
```
[
  '0x967da4048cd07ab37855c090aaf366e4ce1b9f48',
  '0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2',

## API

### getPoolsForToken

Makes request for pools associated to a token, sets nodes on the graph for each pool.
Returns the next tokens to be searched OR null if a path can be made.
```  
pathfinder.getPoolsForToken({
    tokenAddress,
    destinationAddress,
    parentPoolAddress,
    IN,
    amt,
  }: {
    tokenAddress: string;
    destinationAddress: string;
    IN: boolean;
    parentPoolAddress: string;
    amt?: string;
  }): Promise<INextTokensToSearch | null>
  ```


### getTokenPath 

Gets token path for a swap pair. Returns an array of tokens to be traded in order to route to the destination token, optimised to be the shortes path possible.

   ```
    pathfinder.getTokenPath({
    tokenAddress,
    destinationAddress,
    parentPoolAddress,
    amt,
    abortSignal,
    IN,
  }: {
    tokenAddress: string;
    destinationAddress: string;
    IN: boolean;
    parentPoolAddress?: string;
    amt?: string;
    abortSignal?: AbortSignal;
  }): Promise<string[]>
  ```

nodes

The node graph being built by getPoolsForToken()

`pathfinder.nodes`

## Limitations 
Currently the subgraphs being queried are all subgraphs from the most popular dex's on supportedChains:

- uniswap (mainnet)
- quickswap (matic)
- carbonswap (EWT)
- pankackeswap (BSC)
- solarbeam (moonriver)

But there are other pools that are available. Apps like balancer use different pools and subgraphs, and support for these could potentially be added in the future.
